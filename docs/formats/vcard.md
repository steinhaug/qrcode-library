VCardFormat
-----------

vCard is a file format standard for electronic business cards. vCards are often attached to e-mail messages, but can be
exchanged in other ways, such as on the World Wide Web or instant messaging. They can contain name and address 
information, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, URLs, logos, photographs, and audio clips.
